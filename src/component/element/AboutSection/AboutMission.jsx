                This took me back to my teacher training days â€“ what is the
                difference between and aim and an objective when planning
                lessons. The best explanation I was given is that the Aims (your
                Mission) was like the brick wall you hope to build.
              </p>
              <p className=" text-[15px] text-gray font-medium mb-2 ">
                The Objectives (your Aim) are how you are going to lay the
                bricks to build the wall. The trick is to avoid saying the same
                thing twice. Mission
